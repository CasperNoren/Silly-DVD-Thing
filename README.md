# ðŸŽ† Silly DVD Thing

A Silly project I made for fun with my non-programmer girlfriend in JavaScript using the P5 library.

# ðŸ§¶ Features
Not much but I made it really quickly
* The DVD logo bounces arround
* The logo shiftes colors
* Press the screen to spawn balls
* Balls have random size and speed

# That's it.
